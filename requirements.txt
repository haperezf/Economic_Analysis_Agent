# Unstructured has many sub-dependencies.
# Installing 'unstructured' and then specific parsers is usually needed.
# e.g., 'pip install unstructured libmagic python-magic-bin pdf2image'
# For simplicity, LangChain's Unstructured loaders usually guide on missing deps.
# Let's assume the user will install specific unstructured dependencies if errors arise.
# A common one for DOCX is 'python-docx'. For HTML, 'lxml' or 'beautifulsoup4'.
# LangChain's Unstructured loaders try to use what's available.
unstructured # Base unstructured library
# Optional, but good for DOCX and HTML if not pulled by unstructured:
python-docx 
beautifulsoup4 
lxml
# For logging colors (optional, but nice for CLI)
# colorlog
